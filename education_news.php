<h2>FIRST LADY APPRECIATES THE EU FOR SUPPORTING SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN KARAMOJA</h2>
<p>
The First Lady and Minister of Education and Sports, Mrs. Janet Museveni has commended the European Union for their contribution towards the Skilling Uganda Programme in Karamoja. 
</p>
Commissioned in May 2017 and implemented by ENABEL with funding from the Embassy of Ireland, the program has seen over 3,500 youth skilled in different fields. Out of those trained to date 51% are female.

Speaking at St. Daniel Comboni Polytechnic Naoi in Moroto District, where she joined the European Union Heads of Mission’s visit to the institute on Thursday, the First Lady affirmed that Government and the Education Ministry value the relationship with the EU, and the work they have done for the sector.

Mrs. Museveni and the Ambassadors were taken on a guided tour of the newly inaugurated multipurpose workshop with modern equipment at the polytechnic where students undergoing training in motorized construction, plumbing and welding departments, showcased their skills. Earlier the EU delegation also toured the ICT laboratory where teachers will be developing virtual digital lessons contents using Zoom and screen casting.

“Today, we are witnessing the fruits of our relationship with Enabel among the several other things that have been done in TVET such as at Abilonino National Instructors College in Kole district. The quality of the work you have done here at St. Daniel Comboni Technical Institute does speak for itself. And certainly, your presence means a lot to our young people today”, Mrs. Museveni said.

She thanked the development partners for supporting the development of the National Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Policy, an important tool in guiding the sector as the country repositions TVET to become an engine of transformational skills development in the country.

She reported that from their joint mission visit they found out that the Karimojong acknowledge that skilling the youth is not only vital for economic development but is a path away from activities which contribute to insecurity. “Education is the greatest gift that a child can receive, a fundamental right and we as EU member states and development partners we stand ready to support you in ensuring that the children and youth of Karamoja have continued access to quality education in the future”, the Irish envoy said.

Other members of the EU delegation who were on a joint mission visit to Karamoja included the Ambassador of Belgium Rudi Veestraeten, German’s Ambassador Matthias Schauer, Ambassador of Italy Massimiliano Mazzanti, Netherland’s Ambassador Karin Boven, the Swedish Ambassador Maria Hakansson and Ambassador Nicolaj Herjber Peterson of Denmark. They were together with senior staff from the EU and Enabel.

The Deputy Principal Charles Ibwolot said that St Daniel Comboni Polytechnic, a private Institution established under Moroto Catholic Diocese in 1991, was the first vocational institute in Karamoja sub region. He highlighted absence of dormitories for girls which has denied many girls the chance to join the institute, lack of accommodation for staff and a power transformer as some of the challenges facing the institute.
